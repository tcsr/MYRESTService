    "EULAText":"EULA agreements are typically presented to users for acceptance during the installation or set-up stage of the software. A pop-up window that prompts a user to check a box that shows they accept the terms before continuing is a very common and effective way of obtaining acceptance for legal terms. The terms of an EULA define the scope of how the software can be used, and any rights the buyer of the software application may have.Liability of limitation clauses can also be included, to disclose that if the software app damages the equipment or any data of the user, the licensor or provider of the software cannot be held liable for the damages.An EULA is important for software developers because when someone installs, downloads, or uses a copy of your software application on their computer or mobile device, they are, in essence, making a copy of the copyrighted software. This legal agreement will dictate limits and liabilities that come along with personally using this copyrighted software."
